We call this key a caller-id.

To get the caller id, you need to complete your KYC (Know Your Client), which will result in you have a user ID and password with WinstantPay. 
To complete the basic KYC, you need a working email and telephone number.

Once done, send us an email to <api@winstantpay.com> from the registered email and we will get in touch prompty (usually via SMS to your phone 24hours).

Upon verification of that number we will provide your with the caller ID
