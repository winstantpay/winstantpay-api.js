Welcome to the WinstantPay API examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are a few Javascript examples for using the WinstantPay webservice API\n
They demonstrate how to:
    1.) Login to the system and retrieve your user id
    2.) Check your acount balances
    3.) Get a foreign exchange quote
    4.) Book a FX deal on the WinstantPay platform 
    5.) Make an InstantPayment

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that you need a pre-shared key to use the API. 
We call this key a caller-id.

To get the caller id, you need to complete your KYC (Know Your Client), 
which will result in you have a user ID and password with WinstantPay.
To complete the basic KYC, you need a working email and telephone number.

Once done, send us an email to api@winstantpay.com  from the registered email 
and we will get in touch prompty (usually via SMS to your phone 24hours).

Upon verification of that number we will provide your with the caller ID
